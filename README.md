# PHYS 4040 Project

The notebook `data_input_example` contains an example of reading the event samples and extracting the momenta of various particles from them. The event sample file `sm_sample.npz` contains events corresponding to our Standard Model with three neutrino flavours; `bsm_sample.npz` contains events corresponding to a universe with a different number of neutrinos.
